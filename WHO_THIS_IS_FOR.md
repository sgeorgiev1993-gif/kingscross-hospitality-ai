# Who this product is for (working hypothesis)

This system is designed for organisations responsible for the performance,
stability, and resilience of high-footfall urban districts.

## Primary user (hypothesis)

Property / Asset / Estate managers overseeing mixed-use districts
(e.g. retail + food + leisure + transport-adjacent areas).

## The problem they face

- Footfall volatility that cannot be explained by simple seasonality
- Transport disruption and weather amplifying demand swings
- Limited visibility into *when* volatility becomes operational risk
- Decisions are reactive, based on anecdote or lagging reports

## What this system provides

- Early detection of demand instability
- Explainable anomaly signals with confidence
- Seasonal pattern separation (holiday vs normal)
- District-level intelligence, not tenant guesswork

## What this is NOT

- Not POS forecasting
- Not staffing advice
- Not restaurant performance benchmarking
