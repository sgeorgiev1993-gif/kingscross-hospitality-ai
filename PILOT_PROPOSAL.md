External Demand & Disruption Intelligence
Pilot proposal — King’s Cross (January–March 2026)
Prepared by: Kings Cross External Intelligence Project
Status: Pilot / validation phase
Duration: 6–8 weeks
Commercial intent: Exploratory (no commitment)
1. What this is
This pilot provides hourly intelligence on external demand pressure and disruption affecting a defined urban asset area (King’s Cross).
It combines:
Transport conditions (TfL)
Weather
Local events
Observed activity proxies
Seasonal anomaly detection
The output is a single, interpretable signal:
How much external pressure is acting on the area right now, and why.
This is not an occupancy system, CCTV, or tenant analytics.
It focuses exclusively on external conditions that asset teams typically react to late or manually.
2. What problem it addresses
Asset and estate teams often face:
Sudden congestion in common areas
Unanticipated queueing or dwell pressure
Service strain driven by external factors (weather, transport disruption, events)
Post-hoc explanations rather than forward visibility
Existing systems answer “what is happening inside”.
This pilot answers “what is about to happen to the asset from outside.”
3. What the pilot delivers
For a single defined area (King’s Cross):
Hourly pressure index (0–100)
Next-12-hour outlook
Disruption risk classification (low / medium / high)
Seasonal & anomalous behaviour flags
Plain-English explanations of drivers
Delivered via:
Live dashboard (web)
JSON output suitable for internal BI or dashboards
Optional weekly insight summary
No integration work required during the pilot.
4. What makes this different
Model is frozen and explainable (no black-box ML)
Seasonal behaviour is observed, not assumed
Confidence reflects signal agreement, not guesswork
Designed for decision support, not automation
This is intentionally conservative and auditable.
5. What success looks like (pilot criteria)
The pilot is successful if the asset team can answer yes to at least one:
“This would have helped us anticipate pressure last week.”
“This explains patterns we currently struggle to justify internally.”
“This would reduce reactive decision-making during disruptions.”
“We would want this as a background signal going forward.”
No requirement to operationalise during pilot.
6. What is not included (by design)
No personal data
No tenant-level analytics
No CCTV or device data
No prescriptive recommendations
No automation hooks (yet)
This keeps risk, compliance, and expectations low.
7. Commercial framing (post-pilot)
If the pilot is useful, next steps may include:
Ongoing licensed access
Area expansion
API delivery
Portfolio-level roll-up
If not useful, the pilot simply ends.
8. Pilot terms (indicative)
Cost: £0 or nominal (£1–2k) to ensure engagement
Duration: 6–8 weeks
Exclusivity: Area-specific during pilot
IP: Remains with project; insights may be anonymised
9. Why now
Winter 2025–26 has already demonstrated:
Elevated volatility
Transport sensitivity
Seasonal patterns that standard models miss
This pilot uses already-collected data, not future promises.
10. Contact / next step
A 30-minute walkthrough is sufficient to assess relevance.
